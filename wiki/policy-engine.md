# Policy Engine

Five deterministic decision paths evaluated in fixed priority order. Same inputs always produce the same output. No LLM in the enforcement path.

## What it is

The `PolicyEngine` class (`policy_engine.py`) implements the core decision logic. It takes five inputs and returns a `PolicyResult(decision, rule_hit)` tuple.

Inputs:
- `tool_name` — the requested tool
- `capability` — the tool's capability key
- `taint` — whether the request provenance is tainted
- `side_effect_type` — `"read"`, `"internal"`, `"external"`, or `"unknown"`
- `descriptor_hash_valid` — whether the tool's current schema matches its pinned hash

## Decision paths (evaluated in order)

```
1. tool_name not in allowlist
   → ABSENT / tool_not_allowlisted

2. capability_map[capability] == False
   → ABSENT / capability_not_allowed

3. descriptor_hash_valid == False
   → DENY / descriptor_drift

4. taint == True AND side_effect_type == "external"
   → DENY / tainted_external_side_effect

5. (none of the above)
   → ALLOW / default_allow
```

Rules 1 and 2 produce ABSENT. Rules 3 and 4 produce DENY. Only if all four checks pass does the request ALLOW.

The ordering is critical: ABSENT checks run before DENY checks. A tool not in the allowlist cannot trigger a taint violation — it simply does not exist.

## Two implementations

**Python engine** (default): `PolicyEngine` in `policy_engine.py`. Pure Python, no external dependencies. Selected when `policy_engine: python` in the manifest or via `--engine python`.

**OPA engine**: `OPAPolicyEngine` in `opa_engine.py`. Evaluates the same 5 rules using the Rego policy at `safe_mcp_proxy/policies/proxy.rego`. Drop-in replacement — same `decide()` signature. Selected via `policy_engine: opa` in the manifest or `--engine opa`. Supports `subprocess` and `rest` evaluator modes.

Both implementations produce identical decisions for the same inputs. The Rego policy mirrors the Python ordering exactly.
